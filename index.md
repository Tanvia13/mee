### Exploring AI Ethics, Algorithmic Bias, and Digital Health  


Iâ€™m a Digital Humanities student researcher at the University of Alberta, exploring the intersection of technology, accessibility, and society.

## Research Focus

My work delves into **Crip Technology** and **AI ethics**, with a particular focus on how emerging technologies can be made more accessible to marginalized communities. I examine the ways algorithmic systems perpetuate bias and how they can be reshaped to create more inclusive, equitable outcomes in digital spaces.

## Academic Background

Bringing together methods from the humanities and computational studies, my research offers an interdisciplinary approach to the study of technology. I combine critical theory with practical analysis to investigate how AI and algorithmic systems impact vulnerable populations.

## Current Projects

Currently, I am researching how **Crip Technoscience** frameworks can inform the development of accessible technologies that empower disabled people, alongside examining AI ethics and its role in shaping healthcare technologies.

## Beyond Research

Outside of my academic work, I have a passion for **cooking**, experimenting with recipes, and exploring how food culture intersects with identity and society.

This site serves as a hub for my research, writing, and personal projects.
